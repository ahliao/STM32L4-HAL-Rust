# STM32L4-HAL-Rust
HAL implementation for STM32L4 MCUs in Rust. Mainly a practice project to learn embedded Rust. 

Will try to follow the embedded hal 1.0 eventually. Not meant to be a replacement of existing HALs. In fact this HAL is probably going to be more specific to whatever projects I'm thinking on working on.
